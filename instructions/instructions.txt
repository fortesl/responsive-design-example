The Challenge:

Make a responsive page to match the comps presented. 

The Rules:
- There is no minimum or maximum time limit for this test. The expectation is that a candidate would spend less than a few hours on it.
- The menu functionality is optional.
- The candidate can use any artwork; the icons and the hero image can be replaced by whatever is convenient.
- Do NOT use Bootstrap or other CSS frameworks.
- The page will be reviewed at multiple breakpoints.
